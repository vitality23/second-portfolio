# portfolio

hello and welcome back to my page. This assignment was probably a bit harder than I thought it would be, nonetheless I hope it is up to par.
Unfortunately I do not have any personal photos, so I just used the things that I like to do.
In my portfolio you will see that I have, the header and links that will take you to the desired parts of the page.
The main photo i changed to a gif (cause why not).
There is a small description of me and the things I enjoy.
The first picture is also larger than the other three photos.
All photo links take you to the desired web page.
I created a contacts list , I didn't put any of my own conctacts, but it still works nonetheless.
The tricky part was trying to get the photos to size properly with @media tool.
I played around a bit with different phne sizes and tablet sizes to see how effective the code was
ans finally came to the finished product, glad to say I believe it works properly.
I tried my best with making it as close to the mock up as I could, but it was a little harder than I thouht it would be.
